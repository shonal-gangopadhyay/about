  content: `Professionally, I'm currently teaching computer science at the University of Minnesota, but I'm exploring opportunities for a change. While I enjoy teaching, I'm looking for something that aligns more closely with my long-term goals and interests. It's an exciting time, and I'm eager to see where things go next.<br><br>

On a more personal note, I got married in July 2024! It's been an incredible experience, and my wife and I are currently planning a second ceremony that will incorporate the traditions we weren't able to include the first time around. I'm excited for everything ahead as we continue building our life together.<br><br>

Over the past year, I've continued to dedicate myself to martial arts, recently earning my 5th-degree black belt. I also had the opportunity to compete in a tournament, where I placed 1st in weapons and 2nd in forms. Training and competing remain a significant part of my life, and I'm always looking forward to refining my skills and taking on new challenges.<br><br>

Outside of martial arts, I've been looking forward to getting back into disc golfâ€”though, with Minnesota's winter in full force, I'll have to wait until the weather warms up. Once spring arrives, I plan to spend more time on the course and hopefully improve my game.<br><br>

Lately, I've also been staying engaged with politics, following the current administration's actions closely. To put it lightly, the Trump administration has been disastrous, and keeping up with the ongoing developments has only reinforced that perspective. I'll likely share more thoughts on this in future posts, but for now, it's been a major focus of my attention.<br><br>

That's all for now! I'm looking forward to writing more posts, sharing my thoughts on a variety of topics, and continuing to grow this blog.`
