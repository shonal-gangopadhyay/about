  content: `This past Monday, February 24, I began building the HTML pages for my personal website, 
  and today, February 27, I'm excited to share the final deployed version. <br><br>

  While I had encountered HTML for the first time in 2004 when creating a Neopets page and later 
  took formal courses in HTML (9th grade) and JavaScript (10th grade), I never expected that I 
  would actually develop a full website of my own. <br><br>

  The process of building this site has been both enjoyable and rewarding. I particularly 
  appreciate the Request a 3D Print feature, as it integrates one of my hobbies into the 
  project in a meaningful way. <br><br>

  Looking ahead, I'm eager to continue adding new content, improving the website, and sharing 
  my thoughts on a variety of topics, including technology, politics, my hobbies, and other 
  ideas that come to mind. <br><br>

  Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more soon!`
