                    class="project-image">
                <p>Each semester, I iteratively develop an altered drone simulation system with my teaching assistants.
                    Students receive an incomplete code base with intentional design flaws. Over the course of
                    structured labs, they improve the design and expand functionality using design patterns.</p>

                <h4>Development Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Students start with a flawed, incomplete codebase.</li>
                    <li>Through labs, they refactor the design and implement additional functionality.</li>
                    <li>Each extension to the project requires the use of a design pattern.</li>
                    <li>At the end of the semester, students have a fully functioning, well-structured system.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>JIRA for team collaboration and project management.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Extensions and Proof of Concepts</h4>
                <p>Each semester, I design proof-of-concept extensions that students can choose from. Every extension
                    integrates a design pattern to enhance system functionality.</p>

                <h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
                <p>This iterative approach ensures students gain hands-on experience with professional software

                    event-handling strategies.</p>

                <h4>Simulation Events & Implementation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Machines arrive at different stations (machine station, test fix station, repair station).</li>
                    <li>Different priority implementations (Symmetrical, Serviced priority, Failed priority,

                <p>This project explores the use of Stable Diffusion for generating
                    artificial images to enhance classification models. The goal is to mitigate challenges such as small
                    dataset sizes, imbalanced classes, and improper data labeling by creating synthetic training data.
                </p>

                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>Acquiring high-quality labeled training data is often expensive and time-consuming. Our project
                    investigates whether artificially generated images using Stable Diffusion can serve as a substitute
                    for real-world datasets, particularly in training image classifiers for CIFAR-100.</p>

                <h4>Methods & Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generated artificial images using Stable Diffusion based on CIFAR-100 class labels.</li>
                    <li>Scaled images from 512x512 down to 32x32 to match CIFAR-100 resolution.</li>
                    <li>Trained and tested classification models (ResNet50, SeresNet152, DenseNet201) on both real and
                        artificial datasets.</li>
                    <li>Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings & Results</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Training on artificial data resulted in significantly higher classification errors (Top1 Error
                        of 75.14% vs. 22.61% for real CIFAR-100 data).</li>
                    <li>Artificial images suffered from content mismatch, leading to poor generalization.</li>
                    <li>Increasing dataset size improved performance slightly but did not close the gap with real data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Challenges & Insights</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stable Diffusion often generated unrealistic or cartoon-like images at lower resolutions.</li>
                    <li>Some class labels required additional descriptors to produce recognizable images.</li>
                    <li>Training models on synthetic data introduced biases that did not generalize well to real-world
                        test sets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
                <p>Potential applications include data augmentation in medical imaging, adversarial training in
                    cybersecurity, and synthetic dataset creation for machine learning research.</p>
