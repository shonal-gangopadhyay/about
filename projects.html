                <h3>Leveraging Stable Diffusion for Artificial Image Data Generation</h3>

                <p>This project explores the use of Stable Diffusion for generating
                    artificial images to enhance classification models. The goal is to mitigate challenges such as small
                    dataset sizes, imbalanced classes, and improper data labeling by creating synthetic training data.
                </p>

                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>Acquiring high-quality labeled training data is often expensive and time-consuming. Our project
                    investigates whether artificially generated images using Stable Diffusion can serve as a substitute
                    for real-world datasets, particularly in training image classifiers for CIFAR-100.</p>

                <h4>Methods & Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Generated artificial images using Stable Diffusion based on CIFAR-100 class labels.</li>
                    <li>Scaled images from 512x512 down to 32x32 to match CIFAR-100 resolution.</li>
                    <li>Trained and tested classification models (ResNet50, SeresNet152, DenseNet201) on both real and
                        artificial datasets.</li>
                    <li>Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Key Findings & Results</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Training on artificial data resulted in significantly higher classification errors (Top1 Error
                        of 75.14% vs. 22.61% for real CIFAR-100 data).</li>
                    <li>Artificial images suffered from content mismatch, leading to poor generalization.</li>
                    <li>Increasing dataset size improved performance slightly but did not close the gap with real data.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Challenges & Insights</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stable Diffusion often generated unrealistic or cartoon-like images at lower resolutions.</li>
                    <li>Some class labels required additional descriptors to produce recognizable images.</li>
                    <li>Training models on synthetic data introduced biases that did not generalize well to real-world
                        test sets.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
                <p>Potential applications include data augmentation in medical imaging, adversarial training in
                    cybersecurity, and synthetic dataset creation for machine learning research.</p>

                <h3>Data Mining Analysis</h3>

                <p>This project explores data mining techniques to analyze purchasing
                    patterns and clustering methods in large datasets.</p>

                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>The goal is to extract meaningful insights from transaction data, identify frequent itemsets, and
                    apply clustering techniques to categorize data effectively.</p>

                <h4>Methods & Approach</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Frequent itemset mining using support thresholds.</li>
                    <li>Apriori algorithm to analyze product co-occurrences.</li>

                <h4>Key Findings & Results</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mineral water, eggs, spaghetti, French fries, and chocolate were the most frequently bought
                        items together.</li>
                    <li>As support thresholds increased, fewer itemsets remained significant.</li>
                    <li>K-means clustering indicated that k=2 provided the best segmentation.</li>
                    <li>Increasing the number of features in Hashing Vectorizer improved classification accuracy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Challenges & Insights</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choosing the optimal support threshold for frequent itemset mining.</li>
                    <li>Balancing feature size to optimize clustering without overfitting.</li>
                    <li>Interpreting spectral clustering results on high-dimensional data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Real-World Applications</h4>
                <p>The techniques used in this project can be applied in retail analytics, customer segmentation,
                    recommendation systems, and fraud detection.</p>

                <h3>BLaMo Design Document</h3>
                <p>The SLAM Business Layer Module (BLaMo) is a middleware component
                    designed for the SLAM system, which assists municipal parks and recreation boards in managing sports
                    leagues, tournaments, and scheduling.</p>

                <h4>Methodology:</h4>
                <p>The project was developed using an Object-Oriented (OO) design approach with a layered architecture.
                    It consists of four main subsystems: Registration, Scheduling, Payment, and Notification. UML
                    diagrams were created using LucidChart and Draw.io to illustrate class relationships and data flow.
                </p>

                <h4>Key Findings:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Utilizing a modular design improved system scalability and maintainability.</li>
                    <li>Generalizing League and Tournament into a single Competition class reduced redundancy.</li>
                    <li>Third-party services for messaging and payments improved security and reliability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Challenges & Lessons Learned:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balancing flexibility with predefined constraints in database storage.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring smooth integration between BLaMo, UI, and the database.</li>
                    <li>Optimizing performance while maintaining a robust notification and scheduling system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Future Work:</h4>
                <p>Potential improvements include expanding payment options beyond credit/debit cards, enhancing
                    real-time scheduling adjustments, and integrating machine learning for predictive analytics in game
                    scheduling.</p>
